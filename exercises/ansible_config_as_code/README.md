Welcome to our series of interactive labs on using Config as code to configure the Ansible Automation Platrom.  This series covers the following topics for AAP Config as code, it is recomended to go through them in order:

* Config as Code Creating `Execution Environments`
* Config as Code `Automation hub`
* Config as Code `Automation controller`
* Config as Code `Automation controller Workflows`

Configuration as Code(CasC) is the way to maintain all your infrastructure.

These labs will provide code to demonstrate how to use CasC to maintain all aspects of AAP. The provided code will be a starting point, and will guide the user through how to utilize the code, and make it their own. The labs will cover configuring controller, private automation hub, execution environments, as well as the creation of workflows without the GUI with an example to follow along. These principles will help to prevent drift in configuration, allow changes to require approval before implementation, and help to maintain both a development and prod deployment.

## Prereqs
It is Recomended to be familiar with the Automation Controller and Ansible as this lab assumes you are familier with using those products.

If you have not used the Automation controller before, a recomended place to start is the instruct lab
[Introduction to automation controller](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/redhat/tracks/controller-101?token=em_mUfT4xw1TXybXnBr&show_challenges=true) , if you have not done so before.

## Time planning

The time required to do the workshops strongly depends on a couple factors: the number of participants and how much discussions are done in between.

Having said that, each exercise should take roughly 1 hour, for a total of 4 hours. The accompanying presentation itself adds 10 minutes.

If your experience is different in scheduling these workshops, please let us know and file an issue.
